<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/cgxttzV.png)

In this project, I built an image-sharing service. I learned how to handle uploads to a server and store them in the cloud. On the frontend, this project improved my understanding of nested routes.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge.
The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx) was to build an application that allows users
to upload an image and share the link with others. Here are some features that this app includes:

- Upload image via file picker or drag-and-drop
- Uploading page with animation
- Error message displayed if there is an issue on the server

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com)
and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.
From your command line:

```bash
# In the server folder, create a .env file with the following variables:
# NODE_ENV=development
# PORT=3001
# MONGO_URI=
# CLOUDINARY_NAME=

# CLOUDINARY_SECRET=

# Clone this repository
